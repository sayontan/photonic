Galleries on steroids! A stylish lightbox & gallery plugin for WP, Flickr, SmugMug, Picasa, Google Photos, Zenfolio & Instagram photos and videos.

== Description ==

Photonic takes the WordPress gallery and super-charges it with a lot of added functionality. It adds support for several new sources and parameters to enhance the content and look-and-feel of your galleries. It supports <a href='https://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> photos, Albums (Photosets), Galleries and Collections, along with <a href='https://photos.google.com/'>Picasa and Google Photos</a> photos and albums, <a href='https://smugmug.com'>SmugMug</a> folders, albums and images, <a href='https://zenfolio.com'>Zenfolio</a> photos, Photosets and Groups, and <a href='https://instagram.com'>Instagram</a> photos. You can also set up authentication so that visitors can see private and protected photos from each provider.

When used without the Gutenberg editor Photonic by default overrides the <code>gallery</code> shortcode. In case you happen to be using a theme or plugin that already overrides the <code>gallery</code> shortcode, Photonic provides you with the option to use your own shortcode for Photonic galleries. This lets your plugins coexist. Bear in mind that if you deactivate Photonic you will have to remove all instances of this custom shortcode, something that is not required if you stick to the <code>gallery</code> shortcode.

When used with Gutenberg Photonic creates no shortcodes, rather it creates blocks. If some of your posts were written with Gutenberg and some without, Photonic supports both scenarios.

= Lightboxes =

Photonic has built-in support for commonly used lightbox scripts such as:

*	<a href='http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/'>Colorbox</a>
*	<a href='http://fancybox.net/'>Fancybox</a>
*	<a href='http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/'>Fancybox2</a> - not GPL, so the script is not included with the plugin. See the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/third-party-lightboxes/'>Lightboxes</a> page for details
*	<a href='https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/'>Fancybox3</a>
*	<a href='https://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/'>Featherlight</a>
*	<a href='https://osvaldas.info/image-lightbox-responsive-touch-friendly'>Image Lightbox</a>

= Google Photos Support =

The following Google Photos concepts are supported in Photonic:

*	<a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/google-photos/photos/'>Photos</a>
*	<a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/google-photos/albums/'>Albums</a>

= Instagram Support =

Instagram photos <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/instagram/'>are supported in Photonic</a>. You can display your own feed, and photos based on tags, and location-based searches. Note that while code has been written to support tags and locations, Instagram hasn't approved Photonic's access to others' photos. This means that currently only displaying one's own feed will work.

= Enhanced Native Galleries =

Your existing gallery insertions are left intact. However you can add a <code>style</code> parameter to a native gallery to open it up to Photonic. The <code>style</code> parameter can take any of the values documented on the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/layouts/'>Layouts</a> page.

= 500px Support - Historical =

Photos and Galleries (a.k.a. Collections, a.k.a. Sets) on <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/500px/'>500px.com are supported in Photonic</a>, but 500px.com has <a href='https://support.500px.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002435653-API-'>shut down its API access with effect from 15th June 2018</a>. The code has been left in the plugin in case 500px.com revives the API, but for now, 500px.com is not supported.

= Video Support =

Photonic provides gallery and lightbox support for <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/videos/'>videos as well</a>. Videos of the following sorts are supported:

*	External videos from YouTube or Vimeo can be opened in any of the lightboxes apart from Image Lightbox or Thickbox
*	Self-hosted or external videos in MP4 formats can be opened in any of the lightboxes apart from Image Lightbox, PrettyPhoto, Strip or Thickbox
*	Videos hosted by external service providers (Flickr, Google etc.) can be opened as a part of a gallery in any of the lightboxes apart from Image Lightbox, PrettyPhoto, Strip or Thickbox. Some lightboxes have issues with specific features. Please refer to the <a href=''>Lightboxes</a> documentation for more.

= Deep-Linking and Social Sharing =

Photonic provides deep-linking support for non-WP images, and by extension, supports social sharing to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Pinterest.

= Beautiful Layouts =

Photonic displays your galleries either as a grid of square thumbnails (the default), or circular thumbnails (like Jetpack), or random tiles in a justified grid, or a masonry layout, or a random mosaic (a much improved variant of the Jetpack Tiled Gallery layout), or a slideshow. See the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/layouts/'>Layouts</a> page for details.

= Interactive Editing =

The WordPress editor shows up with a button that says "Add / Edit Photonic Gallery". Clicking on it will show you the different types of galleries you can work with.

= Gutenberg Support =

With effect from version 2.10 Photonic is Gutenberg-capable. There are some steps you might need to take to migrate your existing galleries. Please refer to the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/gutenberg-support/'>documentation</a>.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for "Photonic", or by uploading the file downloaded from here.

Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.

Once you have activated the plugin, refer to <em>Photonic &rarr; Getting Started</em> for a list of capabilities and documentation.

== Screenshots ==

For the plugin in action see the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/'>plugin page</a>.

1.	If you are using Gutenberg look for the "Photonic" block
2.	If you are not using Gutenberg insert the shortcode for Photonic through the Media Uploader by clicking "Add Media", or click on "Add / Edit Photonic Gallery".
3.	Clicking on the Gutenberg block, or on "Add / Edit Photonic Gallery" shows up an interactive flow for you to build out your gallery.
4.	The interactive flow shows you the options available and helps construct the gallery easily.
5.	If you click on "Add Media" you will see a new tab for "Photonic". This is not available for Gutenberg.
6.	Clicking on the "Photonic" tab will show you new tabs, one for each type of gallery. Fill out what you need and click "Insert into post".
7.	The gallery placeholder shows up in the "Visual Editor" or in the Gutenberg editor. Each provider's placeholder is designated by its logo.
8.	Clicking on the placeholder lets you edit the attributes of the shortcode if Gutenberg is not being used and the interactive workflow is disabled.
9.	An example of the "Random Justified Gallery" layout.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I disable the plugin what happens to the galleries? =

Obviously, your galleries will not show. If you are using Gutenberg you don't have to worry about anything. If you are not using Gutenberg and you are using the native <code>gallery</code> shortcode, you will not see any empty shortcode tags on your site. But if you are not using Gutenberg and you are using a custom shortcode that shortcode tag will now show up.

= When I click on a gallery in the Visual Editor nothing happens. Is the plugin working? =

Yes, the plugin is working. Unfortunately the integration of Photonic with the visual editor is complex, and there is a likelihood of conflicts with other TinyMCE-specific plugins. If you come across such a conflict, please report it on the support forum. In the meanwhile you can disable the visual editing capability of Photonic (<em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; Generic Options &rarr; Generic Settings &rarr; Disable shortcode editing in Visual Editor</em>) and you should still be able to edit the gallery shortcode directly through the text editor.

= My gallery layout seems to get messed up with random text showing up at various places. Are you sure the plugin is working? =

Yes, the plugin is working. The issue you are facing is that you have another plugin (typically some sort of a lightbox plugin) that is modifying the markup generated by Photonic.

Of course, it would be easiest if you were to disable that plugin. If a lightbox is all you need, Photonic's lightbox can be used to display regular photos as well, from your admin dashboard under <em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; Generic Options &rarr; Generic Settings &rarr; Photonic Lightbox for non-Photonic Images</em>. This will ensure consistency across Photonic and non-Photonic images.

However, if you really wanted to keep that plugin, Photonic offers a way out there too! For each provider (e.g. Flickr, Picasa etc.) go to the Settings page, e.g. <em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; SmugMug &rarr; SmugMug Settings &rarr; Disable lightbox linking</em> and set that option.

= I upgraded, and now my SmugMug galleries won't show. Are you really sure the plugin is working? =

Yes, the plugin is working. Here is what happened: version 1.57 of Photonic moved from API v1.3 of SmugMug to API v2. Your API keys probably were created for v1.3 and need to be authorized for v2. See <a href='https://aquoid.com/2016/12/smugmug-access-in-photonic-1-57/'>here</a> for instructions.

= The plugin says it supports Picasa as well as Google Photos. How is that? =

For over two years after it announced the demise of Picasa in February 2016, the PicasaWeb API was the only way to access Google content. Finally a dedicated Google Photos API was introduced in a <a href='https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/api-limits-quotas'>"Developer Preview" mode</a> in May 2018. Reacting to this Photonic implemented supported for Google Photos, while keeping the Picasa module around. You can still use the Picasa module for old Picasa libraries with <code>authkey</code> protection, and the new Google Photos module for things like shared albums.

See the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/picasa/'>Picasa</a> and <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/google-photos/'>Google Photos</a> documentation pages for instructions.

= Does the plugin support 500px.com? =

The plugin has code to support 500px.com, however 500px.com has shut down its API access with effect from mid June 2018, so you will not be able to obtain an API key for it, and if you have an API key already, it will have stopped working.

= What about other photo-sharing platforms? =

Suggestions are welcome for other photo-sharing platforms.

= What about other JS libraries? =

Currently Colorbox, Fancybox, Fancybox3, Featherlight, Image Lightbox, Lightcase, Lightgallery, PrettyPhoto and Swipebox are supported. Inbuilt support is also present for the non-GPL Fancybox2 and Strip. Both lighter and heavier alternatives are being considered. If you have specific suggestions please feel free to contact the plugin author.

Note that there have been slight modifications to some of the above scripts to make them interact seamlessly with JQuery tooltips.

= Are there any known issues? =

As explained in the "Description", the Instagram API has been coded to support hashtags and locations, but Instagram itself has not provided Photonic access to those features.

Also, the TinyMCE integration for the plugin is complex, predominantly since Photonic doesn't rely on a separate shortcode. This can cause potential conflicts with other plugins. If such a situation arises, please report it in the <a href='https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/photonic/'>Support Forum</a>, and disable the visual editor capability for the shortcode by specific post-types (<em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; Generic Options &rarr; Generic Settings &rarr; Disable Visual Editing for specific post types</em>). If that doesn't work, you can go thermonuclear on Photonic's visual editing (<em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; Generic Options &rarr; Generic Settings &rarr; Disable shortcode editing in Visual Editor</em>) - you will still be able to edit the shortcode using the Text Editor in WordPress.

The "Mosaic" layout may sometimes show 1px wide gaps betweeen images if you set the padding between images to 0. This happens due to rounding errors in the height and width calculations. To avoid this, it is recommended that you use a padding &gt; 0 between images for this layout.

Apart from these, while the plugin can handle pretty much whatever you throw at it, Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology states:
<blockquote>There is always one more bug.</blockquote>

Bug reports are welcome, and handled enthusiastically.

= Are translations supported? =

Yes, but only for the plugin front-end and the interactive workflow. The admin panel is not translated at this point. Also note that any strings included in the third-party JS scripts are not translated.
