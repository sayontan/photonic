# Photonic
Photonic is a WordPress plugin that helps display photos and albums from various sources, including native WordPress, Flickr, Picasa / Google Photos, 500px, SmugMug, Zenfolio and Instagram. Photos can be displayed using thumbnail grids, tiled layouts or slideshows. Several popular lightbox scripts are integrated to facilitate a more immersive experience.
